Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning

- Led data analysis and machine learning efforts to develop a predictive model for heart disease diagnosis, achieving high accuracy using Random Forest algorithm.

- Conducted exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to identify key predictors of positive/negative heart disease diagnosis.

- Utilized a variety of classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost to compare model performance and determine best-fit algorithm.
